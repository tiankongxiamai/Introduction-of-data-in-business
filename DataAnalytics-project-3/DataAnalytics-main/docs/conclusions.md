Western and Northern European Countries face challenges in providing adequate space in densely populated urban centers, potentially affecting quality of life. These countries may benefit from policies promoting more spacious, affordable housing options within cities.
Southern European Countries should address historical limitations in urban housing layouts, potentially by renovating older buildings or developing new residential zones with modern standards.
Eastern European Countries could leverage their relatively balanced urban-rural housing conditions to promote regional development, ensuring that both urban and rural areas offer competitive living standards.


## Conclusion
The degree of urbanization has a clear impact on housing density, with highly urbanized zones typically offering fewer rooms per person. This trend is most pronounced in Western and Northern Europe, where urban centers are densely populated and face space constraints. However, the impact is more muted in Eastern Europe, where historical and policy factors contribute to more consistent housing conditions across regions.

These results underscore the importance of tailored urban planning and housing policies to address regional needs. By promoting balanced development across urban and rural areas, countries can enhance housing quality and equity in living standards, ultimately improving the well-being of their populations.
